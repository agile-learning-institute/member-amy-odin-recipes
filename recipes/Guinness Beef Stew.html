<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>4 slices bacon, cut into small pieces</ul>
<ul>2 1/2 pounds boneless beef chuck, cut into 2-inch pieces</ul>
<ul>1 1/2 teaspoons salt, divided, or more to taste</ul>
<ul>freshly ground black pepper to taste</ul>
<ul>2 onions, coarsely chopped</ul>
<ul>4 cloves garlic, minced</ul>
<ul>1 (14.9 ounce) can dark beer (such as Guinness)</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup tomato paste</ul>
<ul>3 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</ul>
<ul>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</ul>
<ul>4 sprigs fresh thyme</ul>
<ul>1 teaspoon white sugar</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</ul>
<ul>2 1/2 cups chicken stock, or as needed to cover</ul>
<ul>4 cups mashed potatoes (Optional)</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>Cook and stir bacon in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat until bacon is browned and crisp, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn off the heat and transfer
    bacon into a large stew pot, reserving bacon fat in the skillet.</ol>
 <ol>Season beef chuck cubes generously with 1 teaspoon salt and black pepper to 
    taste. Turn heat to high under the skillet and sear beef pieces in the hot fat on
    both sides until browned, about 5 minutes. Place beef in the stew pot with 
    bacon, leaving fat in the skillet. Turn heat down to medium; cook and stir onions
    in the retained fat in the skillet until lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes; season with
    a large pinch of salt. </ol>   
    <ol>Cook garlic with onions until soft, about 1 minute. Pour beer into the skillet and
        stir with a wooden spoon, scraping up and dissolving any browned bits of food
        into the liquid. Pour cooking liquid from the skillet into the stew pot. Stir in tomato paste, carrots, celery,
    thyme sprigs, sugar, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper, and enough chicken broth to cover.
   </ol>
   <ol>Bring stew to a gentle simmer, stirring to combine; reduce heat to low and cover
    pot. Simmer stew until beef iks fork-tender, about 2 hours. Stir stew occasionally
    and skim fat or foam if desired.   </ol>
    <ol>Remove cover and raise heat to medium-high. Bring stew to a low boil and Cook
        until stew has slightly thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove and discard thyme sprigs
        and adjust salt and pepper to taste.
    </ol>
    <ol>Arrange mashed potatoes in a ring in a serving bowl; ladle stew into the center of the potatoes.</ol>
