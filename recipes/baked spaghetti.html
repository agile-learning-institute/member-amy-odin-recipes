<p>Baked spaghetti is the easy, comforting, and crowd-pleasing dinner you're looking for.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</ul>
<ul>1 pound ground beef</ul>
<ul>1 onion, chopped</ul>
<ul>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</ul>
<ul>2 eggs</ul>
<ul>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
<ul>5 tablespoons butter, melted</ul>
<ul>2 cups small curd cottage cheese</ul>
<ul>5 cups shredded mozzarella cheese, divided</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</ol>
<ol>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally,
 until tender but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</ol>
<ol>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir beef and onion in the hot skillet until
    meat is browned and onion is soft and translucent, about 5 to 7 minutes.
</ol>
<ol>Drain excess oil from the pan; stir in spaghetti sauce and seasoned salt.</ol>
<ol>Whisk eggs, Parmesan, and butter in a large bowl. Add spaghetti and toss to coat.</ol>
<ol>Place 1/2 of the spaghetti mixture in the prepared baking dish. Top with 1/2
    of the cottage cheese, 2 cups mozzarella, and 1/2 of the meat sauce. Repeat layers.
    Cover with aluminum foil.
</ol>
<ol>Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove the foil and sprinkle with remaining 1 cup mozzarella.</ol>
<ol>Continue to bake until cheese is melted and lightly browned, 20 to 25 minutes.</ol>
<ol>Serve and enjoy!</ol>
